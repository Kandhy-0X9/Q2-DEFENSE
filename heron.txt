A heron is a tall, long-legged wading bird known for its distinctive slow, deliberate hunting in shallow waters, using its sharp beak to spear fish, frogs, and other small aquatic animals, flying with its neck tucked in an S-shape, and belonging to the family Ardeidae, which also includes egrets and bitterns, found worldwide in wet habitats.
They are skilled predators, highly adaptable to diverse water environments, and build stick nests in trees, often in colonies called heronries, notes National Audubon Society.  

Key Characteristics
    Appearance: Long legs, long neck, dagger-like bill, often gray, brown, or white plumage.
