Cranes are large, graceful birds known for their long legs, necks, and distinctive calls, forming lifelong pairs and performing elaborate "dances" for bonding, with most species migrating vast distances and inhabiting wetlands globally, but the term "crane" also refers to heavy machinery used in construction, with ancient roots in moving large loads. 

Bird Cranes (Family Gruidae)
    Appearance & Size: Tall, with long legs, necks, and bills; plumages are often gray, white, or brown, with some having bare red skin on their heads used for communication.
    Habitat: Prefer wetlands, marshes, and prairies, nesting in vegetation near water.
    Diet: Omnivores, eating plants (seeds, roots) and animals (insects, worms, frogs, rodents).
    Behavior: Form lifelong, monogamous pairs, performing complex "dances" for bonding. They are vocal, with bugling calls heard for miles, and fly in V-formations with necks extended.
    Migration: Many species are long-distance migrants, flying thousands of miles.
    Symbolism: In many cultures, especially Asian, they symbolize longevity, good fortune, marriage, and peace (e.g., origami cranes).

Construction Cranes (Machinery)
    Function: Heavy machinery used in construction to lift and move materials.
    Mechanism: Utilize counterweights for balance and stability, with some, like "Big Carl," being massive structures assembled on-site.
