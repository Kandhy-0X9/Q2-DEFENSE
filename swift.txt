A swift bird is a highly aerial, fast-flying bird known for spending nearly its entire life in the air, eating, drinking, and even sleeping on the wing, which takes about 10 months and rarely landing except to nest in crevices or chimneys with its tiny, weak feet.
They are often mistaken for swallows but are distinct, characterized by long, sickle-shaped wings, dark bodies, and high-pitched screams, expertly catching insects mid-flight and migrating vast distances.  
Key Characteristics
    Built for Flight: Swifts have aerodynamic bodies, long, narrow wings, and a short, forked tail, resembling a boomerang in flight. 
    Aerial Lifestyle: They are aerial insectivores, feeding on insects caught in the air, and have huge mouths to scoop prey. 
    Weak Legs: Their name comes from the Greek ápous, meaning "footless," referring to their tiny, weak legs used only for clinging to vertical surfaces, not perching or walking. 
    Distinctive Calls: You often hear their loud, screaming calls before seeing them, especially in "screaming parties" during summer evenings. 
Common Types
    Chimney Swift: A familiar North American species that nests in chimneys, relying on human structures as trees become less common, notes the National Audubon Society. 
    Common Swift: Found in Europe, known for its sooty-brown color and pale throat patch, also the fastest bird in level flight
    White-throated Swift: A larger swift with prominent white markings, seen in North America. 
Behavior & Habitat
    Nesting: They nest in inaccessible spots like cliffs, crevices, and chimneys, building bowl-shaped nests from saliva and plant matter, says this YouTube video. 
    Migration: Swifts are long-distance migrants, traveling thousands of miles between continents to follow insect availability.
