Skimmer birds are unique seabirds, primarily the Black Skimmer, known for their distinctive feeding style: flying low over water with their elongated lower bill slicing the surface to catch small fish and crustaceans by touch, snapping the bill shut instantly.
They have striking black-and-white plumage, bright red-and-black bills, and unusual vertical slit pupils, enabling them to hunt at dawn, dusk, or night, often called "sea dogs" for their bark-like calls. Found along coasts and estuaries, they nest in colonies on sandy beaches, but face threats from habitat loss due to development. 

Key Characteristics & Behaviors
    Unique Bill: The lower mandible is longer than the upper, used for skimming the water's surface.
    Feeding: They hunt by touch, using their bill to feel for fish, and have large, vertical pupils like cats to reduce glare and see in low light.
    Nocturnal Foraging: Because they rely on touch, they often feed at night or during twilight hours.
    Appearance: Black back and wings with white underparts, a red-and-black bill, and short pink legs.
    Vocalization: Produce a distinctive dog-like bark. 

Habitat & Diet
    Habitat: Coastal areas, including bays, lagoons, estuaries, and river mouths, often roosting on sandbars and beaches.
    Diet: Small fish and crustaceans like shrimp.

Nesting & Conservation
    Nesting: They nest in colonies on barren, sandy beaches or barrier islands, scraping shallow depressions in the sand.
    Conservation Status: Populations are declining due to beach development and disturbance at nesting sites. 

Species
    There are three skimmer species worldwide: the Black Skimmer (Americas), African Skimmer, and Indian Skimmer.
