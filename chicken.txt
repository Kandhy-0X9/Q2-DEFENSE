Chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) are domesticated fowl, descendants of the red junglefowl, widely raised for meat and eggs, known for their intelligence, social structures (pecking order), and complex communication (30+ sounds).
These omnivores, with unique features like combs and wattles, have surprisingly advanced cognitive skills, can recognize faces, fly short distances, dream, and exhibit empathy, living 5-10 years in good conditions.
