Chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) are domesticated fowl, descendants of the red junglefowl, widely raised for meat and eggs, known for their intelligence, social structures (pecking order), and complex communication (30+ sounds).
These omnivores, with unique features like combs and wattles, have surprisingly advanced cognitive skills, can recognize faces, fly short distances, dream, and exhibit empathy, living 5-10 years in good conditions.

Key Characteristics
    Origin: Domesticated from Southeast Asian junglefowl around 8,000 years ago, they are the closest living relatives to dinosaurs.
    Types: Over 60 breeds exist, varying in color, size, and egg-laying, with males called roosters and females hens.
    Diet: Omnivores, eating seeds, insects, fruits, and even small animals like mice.
    Behavior: Highly social, form flocks with a hierarchy (pecking order), communicate extensively, enjoy dust bathing for cleanliness, and can be trained.
    Physical Traits: Have combs (top of head) and wattles (under chin), with egg color often linked to earlobe color.

Origin & Diversity
    Ancestry: Descended from the Red Junglefowl of Southeast Asia.
    Evolution: Considered the closest living relatives to dinosaurs, sharing common ancestry with T. rex.
    Breeds: Over 60 breeds exist, producing different egg colors (white, brown, blue, green) and sizes.

Roles & Behaviors
    Products: Valued for eggs (fertilized or unfertilized) and meat; hens can lay hundreds of eggs annually.
