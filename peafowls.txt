Peacocks are large, colorful birds known for the male's spectacular iridescent train of feathers, used in courtship displays; the term refers to the male, while females are peahens, and both are peafowl, with three species (Indian Blue, Green, Congo) native to Asia and Africa, known for their loud calls, social behavior, and diet of seeds, insects, and reptiles, though the Green and Congo species are endangered due to habitat loss.  

Key Characteristics
    Male (Peacock): Famous for their vibrant, metallic-colored feathers and long "train" (elongated upper tail coverts) adorned with eyespots (ocelli). 
    Female (Peahen): More subdued in color, with shorter trains, helping them camouflage. 
    Crest: Both sexes have a distinctive crest on their heads. 
    Iridescence: Colors are structural, created by light reflecting off microscopic feather structures, not pigments. 

Species & Habitat
    Indian (Blue) Peafowl: Most common, native to India and Sri Lanka, thriving in diverse climates. 
    Green Peafowl: Found from Myanmar to Java; endangered due to habitat loss. 
    Congo Peafowl: A distinct species from African rainforests; vulnerable. 

Behavior & Diet
    Social: Live in groups called "ostentations," "prides," or "parties".
    Diet: Omnivores, eating seeds, fruits, insects, reptiles, and small mammals.
    Roosting: Sleep in tall trees for safety.
    Calls: Known for loud, distinctive calls, especially during mating season.

    Cultural Significance: Sacred in Hinduism (symbolizing eyes of gods) and featured in ancient myths (Hera's bird). 
    Defense: Fiercely defend against snakes, even venomous ones.
