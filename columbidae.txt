Columbidae is the scientific family for all pigeons and doves, known for their stout bodies, small heads, short necks, and slender bills, feeding mainly on seeds and fruits, and found globally except Antarctica, with characteristic cooing sounds and "crop milk" for young.
While smaller ones are often called doves and larger ones pigeons, there's no scientific difference, with the common feral pigeon being descendants of the Rock Dove, and the family is known for strong flight, navigation, and diverse species from tiny ground doves to larger fruit pigeons. 

Key Characteristics
    Appearance: Plump bodies, small heads, short legs, often with fleshy cere (fleshy growth at the base of the bill).
    Diet: Primarily seeds (granivores), fruits (frugivores), and plants, but some eat insects for protein.
    Flight: Powerful flight muscles (around 44% of body weight) and excellent navigation skills using the Earth's magnetic field and sun.
    Reproduction: Build flimsy stick nests, lay 1-2 eggs, and both parents feed chicks a protein-rich "crop milk".
    Sounds: Produce cooing sounds by inflating air sacs in their crop for communication.
    Diversity: Range widely in size and color, from dull grays and browns to vibrant hues, especially in tropical regions. 

Pigeons vs. Doves
    No Scientific Distinction: The terms are used colloquially, with smaller birds called doves and larger ones pigeons, but they belong to the same family.
    Feral Pigeons: The common city pigeon is the feral descendant of the wild Rock Dove (Columba livia).
