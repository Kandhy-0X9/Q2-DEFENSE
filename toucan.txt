Toucans are iconic, colorful birds from Central and South American rainforests, famous for their oversized, lightweight bills used for reaching food and regulating body heat, though they aren't strong fliers, preferring to hop.
They nest in tree hollows, eat primarily fruit, insects, and small vertebrates, and live in pairs or small flocks, facing threats from deforestation and illegal pet trade.  

Key Characteristics:
    Large, Colorful Bill: The most striking feature, made of keratin (like fingernails), helps them reach fruit and cool down, but it's surprisingly light. 
    Body: Stocky, with short wings, strong legs, and often glossy black plumage with bright patches. 
    Habitat: Tropical rainforests of the Americas, living in the canopy. 
    Diet: Primarily fruit (frugivores), but also insects, lizards, and even eggs. 
    Social Behavior: Live in pairs or small groups, often sharing fruit trees. 
    Nesting: Use existing tree cavities, often hollowed out by woodpeckers, to lay 2-4 eggs. 

Interesting Facts:
    They belong to the same family (Ramphastidae) as toucan barbets and are related to woodpeckers. 
    Their bill has serrated edges to help them tear food. 
    They tuck their bill under their wing and flip their tail over their head to sleep, forming a compact ball. 
    Despite their large bill, they aren't strong fliers, preferring hops and glides. 
    About 40-50 species exist, from small Aracaris to large Toco Toucans. 

Threats: 
    Habitat loss due to deforestation (for cattle, soy).
    Illegal wildlife trade for the exotic pet market.
