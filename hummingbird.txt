There are three skimmer species worldwide: the Black Skimmer (Americas), African Skimmer, and Indian Skimmer.
They are the smallest birds, with fast heartbeats and migrations spanning thousands of miles, making them tiny but tough survivors with big appetites for energy.  

Key Characteristics
    Size & Weight: Among the world's smallest birds, often weighing less than a penny, with some species as small as a bee. 
    Feathers: Males often have colorful throat patches (gorgets) that flash iridescent colors in the sun. 
    Beak: Long, slender bills adapted for sipping nectar from flowers, with a unique tongue mechanism. 
    Metabolism: Have extremely high metabolisms, needing to eat almost constantly. 
    Heart: Their heart can beat over 500 times a minute, even faster in flight. 

Flight Abilities
    Wing Beats: Wings flap incredibly fast (up to 80 times/second), creating a humming sound, hence the name. 
    Maneuverability: Can fly forward, backward, upside down, and hover, unique among birds. 
    Speed: Can reach speeds up to 60 mph in dives. 

Diet & Feeding
    Primary Food: Nectar provides energy, but they also eat insects and spiders for protein and minerals. 
    Feeding Habits: Visit hundreds of flowers daily and defend feeding territories aggressively. 
    No Sense of Smell: Rely on color (especially red/orange) to find flowers, not scent. 

Migration & Habitat
    Range: Found from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego, but most species are in Central and South America. 
    Migration: Some species undertake long migrations (e.g., 3,000 miles for the Rufous Hummingbird). 

Reproduction
    Nests: Build tiny, cup-shaped nests from plant materials, moss, and spider silk. 
    Eggs: Lay 1-2 very small eggs, often the size of a coffee bean.
