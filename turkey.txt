Turkeys are large, ground-dwelling birds native to the Americas, known for their gobbling calls, iridescent feathers, and distinctive fleshy features like the snood and wattle, which change color with mood.
Two main species exist: the Wild Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) and the Ocellated Turkey, with males (toms) being larger and more colorful than females (hens).
They are fast runners and capable short-distance flyers, using their speed and aerial ability to escape predators

Key Characteristics
    Appearance: Large, heavy bodies with long legs; males have a beard (bristle of feathers on the chest) and colorful, bare heads/necks; females are duller brown.
    Snood & Wattle: Fleshy growths that hang over the beak (snood) and under the chin (wattle) that change color (red, white, blue) to show excitement or stress.
    Size: Wild turkeys can weigh 10-25 pounds, with wingspans up to 5 feet, and stand up to 4 feet tall.
    Vocalization: Famous for the male's "gobble," but also make yelps, purrs, and clucks.
    Senses: Excellent vision (270-degree field of view) and hearing. 

Behavior & Habitat
    Habitat: Forests and woodlands, roosting in trees at night.
    Diet: Omnivorous, eating seeds, fruits, insects, and small reptiles.
    Social Structure: Live in flocks; males (toms) strut and fan their tails to attract females (hens).
    Movement: Can run up to 25 mph and fly short distances at 50-55 mph to escape danger.

Species & Domestication
    Wild Turkey: The species native to North America, with five subspecies.
    Ocellated Turkey: Found in the Yucatán Peninsula, smaller with iridescent blue/green feathers and eye-spots.
    Domestication: Domestic turkeys (often white) were bred from wild turkeys for meat and are typically too heavy to fly.
