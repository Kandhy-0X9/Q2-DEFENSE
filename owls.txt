Owls are nocturnal birds of prey known for silent flight, forward-facing eyes, and exceptional hearing, allowing them to hunt small animals like rodents, insects, and birds with sharp talons and hooked beaks, existing in two families (True Owls and Barn Owls) across most of the world, excluding Antarctica, and possessing unique adaptations like neck rotation to see their surroundings. 

Physical Characteristics & Adaptations
     Eyes & Vision: Large, fixed, tube-shaped eyes give them excellent binocular vision but require head rotation (up to 270 degrees) to see sideways or backward, aided by special blood vessels.
    Hearing: Asymmetrical ears help pinpoint sounds in 3D space, crucial for hunting in the dark.
    Feathers: Soft, specialized feathers allow for nearly silent flight, making them stealthy hunters.
    Feet: Zygodactyl feet (two toes forward, two back) provide a powerful grip, with one back toe able to pivot.

Behavior & Diet
    Activity: Mostly nocturnal, but some are diurnal (day-active) or crepuscular (dawn/dusk).
    Diet: Carnivores, eating small mammals, insects, other birds, and sometimes fish; they regurgitate indigestible parts as pellets.
    Vocalization: Known for hoots, but also use chirps, screeches, and bill snaps for communication. 

Types & Habitat
    Families: Divided into Strigidae (true owls, round faces) and Tytonidae (barn owls, heart-shaped faces).
    Habitat: Found globally except in polar regions, living in forests, grasslands, tundra, and deserts.
    Size: Varies from tiny Elf Owls (5 inches) to large Great Horned Owls (up to 28 inches). 

Threats
    Owls face threats from habitat loss, vehicle collisions, poisons, and persecution due to superstitions.
