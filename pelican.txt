Pelicans are large water birds known for their huge throat pouches used to scoop fish from lakes and coasts, with species like the American White Pelican and Brown Pelican using different feeding styles (group herding vs. diving).
They are excellent flyers, gliding efficiently and diving steeply, while using air sacs for cushioning impacts.
Pelicans are social, eat fish, and are found worldwide, often near water bodies, but face threats like pollution and fishing gear.  

Key Characteristics
    Distinctive Pouch: A large, featherless throat pouch hangs from their long bill, used for catching prey and draining water. 
    Size: Among the largest flying birds, with wingspans over 7-9 feet for some species. 
    Appearance: Generally pale (white/grey), but Brown Pelicans are dark, and all develop bright colors before breeding. 
    Habitat: Found near lakes, rivers, and seacoasts globally, often in large groups for feeding and breeding. 

Behavior & Diet
    Feeding: They catch fish by diving (Brown Pelican) or herding fish into shallows (American White Pelican). 
    Flight: Skilled flyers, they glide just above water and can dive from great heights, using air sacs to cushion the impact. 
    Social: They often fish and breed in groups. 
    Adaptations & Threats
    Survival: Stiffen neck muscles and use air sacs for impact absorption during dives. 
    Threats: Suffer from oil spills, fishing hooks, pesticides, and pollution. 

Interesting Facts
