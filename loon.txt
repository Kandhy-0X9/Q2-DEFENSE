Loons are iconic, migratory water birds known for their haunting calls, distinctive black-and-white breeding plumage, and red eyes, symbolizing wilderness; they are expert divers with solid bones for deep dives, feeding mainly on fish, and are awkward on land due to their powerful legs set far back for swimming, nesting on northern lakes in summer and wintering on ocean coasts. 
There are five species globally, but the Common Loon (Gavia immer) is the most well-known in North America, recognized by its yodel, wail, and tremolo calls.

Key Characteristics & Adaptations
    Diving Experts: Solid bones, not hollow like most birds, help them sink to hunt fish, staying underwater for minutes.
    Vocalizations: Famous for their yodels (territorial), wails (long-distance contact), and tremolos (agitation).
    Land Awkwardness: Legs positioned for powerful swimming make walking difficult; they only come ashore to nest.
    Salt Glands: Specialized glands above their eyes filter salt, allowing them to drink seawater and eat saltwater fish in winter.

Habitat & Behavior
    Breeding: Summer on northern freshwater lakes; build nests near water on islands or sheltered bays.
    Wintering: Migrate to coastal marine waters.
    Diet: Primarily fish, but also insects and small aquatic animals.
    Nesting: Lay 1-2 eggs; chicks often ride on parents' backs for warmth, rest, and protection.

Species & Symbolism
    Species: Five species worldwide (Common, Red-throated, Pacific, Arctic, Yellow-billed).
    Symbol: The Common Loon is a powerful symbol of wild, unspoiled northern waters, featured as Minnesota's state bird.
