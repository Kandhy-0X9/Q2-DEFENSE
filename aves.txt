Aves is the scientific class for birds, a diverse group of warm-blooded vertebrates defined by feathers, beaked jaws, laying hard-shelled eggs, and a high metabolism, with adaptations like lightweight skeletons and unique respiratory systems supporting flight, making them the most diverse group of land vertebrates with roughly 10,000 species living globally today. 

Key Characteristics
    Feathers: Essential for insulation, flight (lift/thrust), and display, varying from downy (insulation) to stiff flight feathers.
    Skeleton: Lightweight and strong, often with hollow bones (pneumatized) and fused bones for rigidity, crucial for flight.
    Metabolism & Circulation: High metabolic rate, four-chambered heart for efficient oxygen delivery, and a one-way respiratory system for constant fresh air.
    Jaws: Toothless beaks, with a digestive system featuring a crop (moistens food) and gizzard (grinds food).
    Reproduction: Oviparous (egg-laying), with complex embryonic development inside hard-shelled eggs. 

Diversity & Evolution
    Species: Around 10,000 species exist worldwide, from hummingbirds to ostriches, making them the most species-rich tetrapod class.
    Origins: Birds are the direct descendants of dinosaurs and are considered the last surviving lineage of dinosaurs.
    Classification: Belong to Kingdom Animalia, Phylum Chordata, Subphylum Vertebrata, and are further divided into Orders, Families, Genera, and Species (e.g., Passeriformes/songbirds are the largest order). 

Adaptations for Flight & Life
    Flight: Powerful pectoral muscles, wing shape (asymmetrical feathers for lift), and streamlined bodies are key adaptations.
    Senses: Highly developed brains, with the cerebellum for movement and cerebrum for behavior; eye placement affects vision (wide field vs. binocular).
    Habitat: Found in virtually every environment, including air, oceans, forests, deserts, and polar regions.
