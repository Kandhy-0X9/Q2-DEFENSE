The Osprey, or "fish hawk," is a large, distinctive raptor known for its fish-based diet, globally found near water, and unique hunting style of diving feet-first to catch prey, showcasing remarkable adaptations like oily feathers and reversible outer toes, making it a common sight near coasts, lakes, and rivers where it builds large stick nests on tall structures or trees. 

Appearance & Identification
    Coloration: Dark brown back, white underside, and a striking white head with a broad dark brown stripe through the eye (mask).
    Flight: Characterized by a distinctive "M" shape or crooked bend in its wings when soaring.
    Size: A large raptor, with a wingspan of 4-6 feet, often mistaken for a bald eagle but smaller. 

Habitat & Diet
    Habitat: Found near fresh or saltwater bodies (lakes, rivers, coasts, marshes) globally, except Antarctica, wherever fish are abundant.
    Diet: Almost exclusively fish, caught by hovering and plunging feet-first into the water. 

Adaptations for Fishing
    Oily Feathers: Help repel water.
    Retractable Nostrils: Close to prevent water entry during dives.
    Specialized Feet: Sharp talons with rough scales and reversible outer toes (turning backward) to grip slippery fish.
    Vision: Can spot fish from high above, with a protective third eyelid for underwater visibility. 

Nesting & Behavior
    Nests: Huge stick nests built in tall trees, cliffs, or on man-made structures like utility poles, often near water.
    Pair Bonds: Mate for life and return to the same nests year after year. 

Status
    Global Presence: One of the most widespread birds, present on all continents except Antarctica.
    Conservation: Have shown significant population recovery, especially in North America, after the ban on DDT.
