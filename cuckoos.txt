Cuckoos are a diverse bird family, famous for their iconic "cuckoo" call and, most notably, for brood parasitism, where females lay eggs in other birds' nests for the host to raise, often ejecting the host's young.
They are insectivores, eating caterpillars and bugs, and inhabit diverse global environments, with species ranging from the common cuckoo to roadrunners.
Many cuckoo populations face significant declines, making them a conservation concern.

Key Characteristics
    Brood Parasitism: The defining trait, where females trick other birds (hosts) into raising their chicks.
    Diet: Primarily insects, especially large caterpillars, but also small animals like lizards.
    Appearance: Varies by species; often slender with long tails and gray/brown plumage, but some are colorful.
    Call: The male's "cuckoo" call is famous, but females have a bubbling call, and other species have unique sounds.
    Distribution: Found worldwide, except Antarctica, with many species in Asia, Africa, and Australasia.

Behavior & Life Cycle (Common Cuckoo Example)
    Nest Mimicry: Female cuckoos can mimic predatory calls to scare host parents away from their nests.
    Egg Laying: They lay their eggs quickly in a host's nest, often removing one of the host's eggs.
    Hatching & Ejection: Cuckoo chicks hatch faster and often push other eggs or hatchlings out of the nest to monopolize food.
    Migration: Many, like the European cuckoo, migrate thousands of miles to Africa for winter.

Conservation Status
    Threatened Populations: Populations of the common cuckoo and Yellow-billed Cuckoo (in North America) have declined dramatically.
    Reasons for Decline: Habitat loss, changes in insect populations, and climate change are major factors.
