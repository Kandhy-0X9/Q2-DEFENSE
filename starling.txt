Starlings (like the European Starling) are adaptable, noisy, social birds known for their iridescent plumage, complex mimicry, and large flocks (murmurations), often considered invasive in North America due to their aggressive competition with native birds, though they also perform beneficial roles like eating insects and serving as subjects in language research, adapting to human-altered landscapes by probing for grubs.

Appearance & Behavior
    Plumage: Glossy black with purple/green iridescence in summer; speckled white in winter; juveniles are drab gray-brown.
    Bill: Dark in winter, bright yellow in breeding season.
    Sound: Mimic other birds and create complex whistles, clicks, and rattles; form noisy flocks.
    Movement: Walk or run on lawns; flight is direct and swift.
    Feeding: Probe the ground with their bills (open-bill probing) to find insects, worms, and larvae.

Introduction to North America & Impact
    Origin: Native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa; introduced to North America in 1890 by Shakespeare enthusiasts.
    Invasive Status: Considered invasive due to rapid population growth (over 200 million in North America) and competition with native cavity-nesting birds.
    Problems: Cause agricultural damage by eating fruits, create large messes with droppings, and outcompete native species for nest sites. 

Habitat & Diet
    Habitat: Highly adaptable, found in open country, urban areas, and near humans, avoiding dense forests and deserts.
    Diet: Omnivorous, eating insects (grubs, moths, beetles) and fruits (berries, cherries).

Interesting Facts
    Murmurations: Form massive, swirling flocks in winter.
    Mimicry: Can mimic car alarms and human speech; Mozart famously owned one.
    Adaptation: Their gut length changes seasonally to adapt to insect or seed-heavy diets.
