Albatrosses are magnificent, large seabirds renowned for their massive wingspans and incredible long-distance gliding flights over the open ocean, spending most of their lives at sea and only landing to breed on remote islands, but many species are threatened by fishing bycatch, plastic pollution, and habitat loss, despite their longevity and complex lifelong partnerships. 

Key Characteristics
    Wingspan: They have the largest wingspans of any bird, with the Wandering Albatross reaching up to 11.5 feet, allowing for highly efficient, tireless flight.
    Flight: Masters of dynamic soaring, they use wind patterns to glide vast distances with minimal flapping, covering thousands of kilometers.
    Diet: They feed on squid, fish, and krill, often scavenging or surface-seizing, and can even drink saltwater thanks to special salt glands.
    Lifespan & Mating: Albatrosses are very long-lived (some over 70 years) and form lifelong monogamous bonds, celebrated with elaborate courtship dances.
    Breeding: They lay a single egg, with both parents caring for it, and young birds may stay at sea for years before returning to breed.

Habitat & Range
    Primarily found in the Southern Ocean and North Pacific, avoiding the calm equatorial winds.

Threats & Conservation
    Fishing Bycatch: Accidental entanglement in fishing gear (longlines) is a major cause of death, notes the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
    Plastic Pollution: They ingest plastic debris, mistaking it for food, which can be fatal.
    Endangered Status: Many of the 22 species are threatened or endangered due to these human-caused pressures, highlights Treehugger.

Cultural Significance
    Sailors once held them in superstitious awe, and their majestic presence remains a powerful symbol in maritime lore.
