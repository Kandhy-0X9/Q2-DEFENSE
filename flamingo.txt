Flamingos are iconic, social wading birds known for their long legs, S-shaped necks, and vibrant pink color, derived from carotenoids in their diet of algae and crustaceans, which they filter feed upside-down using specialized bills in large flocks called "flamboyances".
They build mud-mound nests and raise chicks, which are born grey and develop their signature pink hue as they mature.
Found in warm regions worldwide, they are skilled flyers and use complex group displays for courtship and communication.

Key Characteristics
    Color: Pink, red, or orange due to pigments (carotenoids) in their food; chicks are born white/grey.
    Body: Stilt-like legs (actually ankles bent backward), long necks, curved bills.
    Size: Varies by species, from 3 to 5 feet tall.
    Habitat: Shallow lakes, lagoons, and mudflats in tropical/subtropical areas.

Diet & Feeding
    Filter Feeders: Eat algae, brine shrimp, insects, and mollusks.
    Unique Method: Dip heads upside-down, use their large, rough tongue and hairy "lamellae" in their beaks to filter food from water and mud. 

Social Behavior
    Flamboyance: Live in large colonies for safety and efficient feeding.
    Communication: Use honks, growls, and complex synchronized dances (head-flagging, wing-salutes) for courtship.

Reproduction & Development
    Nests: Volcano-shaped mounds of mud.
    Eggs: Females lay one egg; both parents incubate.
    Chicks: Born grey, develop pink color over time.

Unique Facts
    One Leg: Often stand on one leg to conserve body heat.
    Flight: Capable of flying fast (up to 35 mph).
    "Crop Milk": Both parents feed chicks a special fluid.
